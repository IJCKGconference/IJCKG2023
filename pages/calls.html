		The 12th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs (IJCKG 2023 , in cooperation with ISWC) is a premium
		academic forum on Knowledge Graphs. The mission of IJCKG 2023 is to bring together international researchers in the
		Knowledge Graph community and other related areas to present their innovative research results or novel applications of
		Knowledge Graphs. IJCKG has evolved from the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST): a joint event
		for disseminating research results regarding the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, Linked Data and AI on the Web.

		IJCKG 2023 is pleased to invite submissions for the Posters and Demonstration session, which complements the full papers
		of the conference. This session provides an opportunity to present late-breaking research results, ongoing research
		projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. Poster and Demo presentations allow researchers to present
		their work directly to the audience and receive feedback on significant work in progress, bleeding-edge work, or
		research that is best communicated interactively or graphically.
