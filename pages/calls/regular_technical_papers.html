<p class="text-justify">
    The 12th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Graphs (IJCKG 2023) is a premium
    academic forum on Knowledge Graphs. The mission of IJCKG 2023 is to bring together international researchers in the
    Knowledge Graph community and other related areas to present their innovative research results or novel applications
    of Knowledge Graphs. IJCKG has evolved from the Joint International Semantic Technology Conference (JIST): a joint
    event for disseminating research results regarding the Semantic Web, Knowledge Graphs, Linked Data and AI on the
    Web.
</p>

<h3>Submission types</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    One of the main goals of IJCKG is to unify the research community working on diverse aspects of Knowledge Graphs. As
    well as <b>regular research papers</b> (up to 8 pages ACM format, excluding references), we thus additionally
    solicit <b>short
        papers</b> (up to 4 pages ACM format, excluding references) that summarize research results (i.e., concise
    versions of
    full research papers).
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    In addition to regular papers, this year IJCKG 2023 will call foster research papers in the following topics chaired
    by the following area chairs:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Representation and Reasoning. Markus Kroetzsch, TU Dresden, Germany</li>
    <li>Database. Jan Hidders, Birkbeck, University of London, UK</li>
    <li>Information Retrieval. Jeff Dalton, University of Glasgow, UK</li>
    <li>Natural Lanauage Processing. Peng Liu, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway</li>
    <li>Machine Learning. Lemei Zhang, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway</li>
</ol>

<p class="text-justify">
    Details of each area will be provided later.
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    All papers should be clearly written, technically sound, and include discussion of related works. Authors should
    clearly indicate in the abstract and the introduction what type of paper they are submitting.
</p>

<h3>Submission</h3>
<p class="text-justify">
    Submissions to IJCKG 2023 should describe original work on Knowledge Graphs. IJCKG 2023 will not accept submissions
    that are under review for or have already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another
    conference (*).
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    * Non peer-reviewed documents such as theses, technical reports, publications on preprint servers (e.g., arXiv.org)
    or workshops papers without formal proceedings are not considered prior publications. In such cases, IJCKG 2023
    authors are not precluded from submitting papers on the same topic by the same authors.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Full research papers submitted to IJCKG 2023 are expected to present their claimed research contribution, with clear
    evidence to support their claims.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    All submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the Program Committee of the Research Track. These
    anonymous reviewers will judge each paperâ€™s relevance to the conference, technical soundness, and the readability of
    the submission.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    IJCKG 2023 submissions are not anonymous.
</p>

<p>
    Submissions must be in PDF format, using the latest ACM Proceedings Format with the default 9pt font (see
    sample-sigconf.tex or Interim layout.docx from <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template"
        target="_blank">https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template</a>).
</p>
<p class="text-justify">
    <b>Regular research paper</b> submissions must be no longer than <b>8 pages</b>, excluding references. <b>Short
        paper</b> submissions must be no
    longer than <b>4 pages</b>, excluding references. Unlimited additional pages may be used for references. Submissions
    that
    exceed this limit or that do not follow the indicated format may be rejected without review.
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    At least one author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the paper there.
</p>

<p>
    Papers can be submitted electronically via <span style="color:red">EasyChair</span>.<br /> <a target="_blank"
        href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijckg2023">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijckg2023</a>
    (select a track from regular research papers or foster research papers for five areas).
</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    Accepted papers will be published in the ACM Digital Library within its International Conference Proceedings Series
    (ICPS). Papers for which authors do not register and present may be excluded from the proceedings.
