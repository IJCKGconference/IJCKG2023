<p class="text-justify">
    IJCKG 2023 is pleased to invite submissions for the Posters and Demonstration session, which complements the full
    papers
    of the conference. This session provides an opportunity to present late-breaking research results, ongoing research
    projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress. Poster and Demo presentations allow researchers to present
    their work directly to the audience and receive feedback on significant work in progress, bleeding-edge work, or
    research that is best communicated interactively or graphically.

</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    We welcome submissions relevant to the area of knowledge graphs, which would address, but are not limited to, the
    topics
    mentioned in the Call for Papers of IJCKG 2023 full papers. We encourage submissions that describe ongoing or
    completed
    research work, reports on software systems, "idea papers" that raise interesting questions or motivate interesting
    lines
    of research without already having solid results, position papers that present a birds' eye view of some aspect of
    knowledge graph as a meta-analysis, and PhD thesis abstracts. Demonstrations are intended to showcase innovative
    knowledge graphs and related implementations. All submissions should convey a scientific result or work in progress
    and
    should not be advertisements for commercial software packages.

</p>

<p class="text-justify">
    All Poster and Demo papers will be reviewed. Accepted poster papers will be published in the CEUR Workshop
    Proceedings and distributed to conference attendees, but will not be included in the ACM proceedings. At least one
    author of each accepted paper must register for the conference and present the poster. Submissions must be in PDF
    format and no longer than 4 pages, using the CEURART (<a href="https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/" > https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-style/</a>) with the one-column variant. All submissions should be
    made via the EasyChair
    system at <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijckg2023"
        target="_blank">https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ijckg2023</a> (select the category "Poster and Demo").
