                Franz Baader is full professor for Theoretical Computer Science at TU Dresden (Germany) since 2002 and
                director of the
                Institute for Theoretical Computer Science at TU Dresden since 2005. He has received his doctoral degree
                (Dr.-Ing.) in
                Computer Science from the University of Erlangen-Nürnberg in 1989, and from 1989 to 1993 was senior
                scientist and
                project leader at the Germany Research Center for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI) in Kaiserslautern and
                Saarbrücken. From
                1993 to 2002 he was professor for Theoretical Computer Science at RWTH Aachen.

                His main research areas are Logic in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, and there in
                particular Automated
                Deduction and Knowledge Representation. He and his research group have worked on Description Logics for
                30 years, and
                have laid the logical and algorithmic foundations for the Description Logics underlying OWL and the
                OWL 2 profile
                OWL 2 EL. They have also developed algorithmic tools that support building and maintaining large
                ontologies. Franz
                Baader is a fellow of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence (EurAI) since 2004 and a
                member of the
                Academia Europaea since 2011. In 2020 he received the Herbrand Award for Distinguished Contributions to
                Automated
                Reasoning.

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p class="allign-justify">
                Ontologies based on Description Logics (DLs) may contain errors, which are usually detected when
                reasoning produces
                consequences that follow from the ontology, but do not hold in the application domain modeled by the
                ontology. In
                previous work, we have investigated repair approaches for ontologies written in the inexpressive DL EL,
                which is, e.g.,
                used in biomedical ontologies. In particular, we have developed approaches producing repairs that are
                optimal in the
                sense that they preserve a maximal set of consequences. In this talk, I will explain the advantages that
                optimal repairs
                have over previously introduced notions of ontology repair, and then give a gentle introduction into the
                approaches we
                have developed for computing them. I will also sketch new results that address the problems that optimal
                repairs may
                become very large or need not even exist in some cases. Basically, one can deal with these problems by
                introducing
                concise representations of optimal repairs.

                Yudai Nakamoto joined SCSK Corporation in 2020. From 2021, he has been working on a method by knowledge
                graph to handle terminology and background knowledge at low cost in the Japanese model of BERT, a
                large-scale language model. Currently, he is working on the conceptual verification of each use case and
                problem-solving for the use of generative AI in business applications.

            <p class="allign-justify">
                Generative AI, including ChatGPT, is spreading rapidly, and various organizations are using it on a
                trial basis or introducing it into their products. SCSK Corporation is also actively working on the use
                of generative AI, including the construction of a question-and-answer system based on ChatGPT. In this
                presentation, I will talk about a question-and-answering system utilizing a vector database that handle
                unique data, and discuss the use of knowledge graphs as a solution to the system’s issues.
